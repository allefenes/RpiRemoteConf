<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Brain.png" alt="Brain" width="40" height="40" /> This documentation is how I use it, I am open to your suggestions and feedback.

It works mostly without any problems with Raspberry-pi 4B (8GB). Sometimes there are communication errors, but I mentioned my solutions in the bonus section.<br>

I connect raspberry-pi to my computer with an ethernet cable. And I provide all communication via SSH. When used in this way, the cable of the Ethernet cable becomes very important for performance.

### [STEP 01 - Prepare The SD Card For Operating System](sdCard.md)
I special develop and write your operating system into your SD card on the Raspberry Pi.

### [STEP 02 - SSH Connection With PUTTY](ssh.md)
I connect to raspberry-pi via SSH connection and enable raspberry-pi VNC feature.

### [STEP 03 - VNC Connection](vnc.md)
I install the vnc viewer application on my computer and connect to raspberry-pi via remote desktop.

### [STEP 04 - Share WIFI Connection With RPI](wifi.md)
I share my internet connection, which I access via wifi on my computer, with my raspberry-pi via ethernet cable.

### [STEP 05 - File Transfer With SFTP](sftp.md)
I simply use the SFTP program to transfer files between my computer and raspberry-pi.
