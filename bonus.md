- Don't try anything impatiently.
- Do not save password in Real VNC Viewer. If there is a saved session, delete it and re-enter it with the address "raspberrypi.local" from the bar above.
- If it is stuck for a long time, just unplug the ethernet cable from the raspberry-pi and plug it back in after a while.
- I should point out that when you share your internet with Raspberry Pi, remote desktop communication slows down. I recommend keeping it off if unnecessary.
