[Raspberry PI Imager - Official Download Page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)<br>

- I download Raspberry Pi Imager from the official website above.
  
- Afterwards, I insert the SD card into my computer. If the SD card I use is fast and large in size, the system will run more efficiently.
  
- I open the Raspberry Pi Imager program. I go to this page by selecting my card, operating system and SD card from left to right and clicking next.

- My operating system starts loading to the SD card according to its presets.
- When the installation is completed, it automatically checks the uploaded files.

- When the installation process is completed, I complete the installation process with the "CONTINUE" button.

- When I insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and connect the power connection, the installation process will begin.
- Since we cannot see the installation process, we must leave the Raspberry Pi running for a while.
- Note: If a problem is encountered in these processes, the SD card partitions are cleaned and merged with Windows Create and format hard disk partitions. You can review the relevant section under the [bonus section](bonus.md#Create-and-Format-Hard-Disk-Partitions).
